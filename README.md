# 2pCode
Personal two-photon preprocessing &amp; analysis code

## Usage
Preprocessing (image registration, dF/F calculation, etc) largely performed by Flyg (private Wilson lab code repository). This code tweaks the end of the preprocessing stage and performs all data analyses & visualizations seen in Westeinde *et al*., 2024 as well as containing a large amount of test code and WIP.
